Use concrete examples: 'For instance, many of our current students use FEE-HELP to focus on their studies without financial stress.' Always confirm understanding and invite questions: 'Would you like me to clarify any aspect of how FEE-HELP works?'

Start with validation: 'Balancing study with work is a common concern, and our program is designed specifically with working professionals in mind.' Share practical strategies: 'Many of our successful students start with two units, creating a manageable 15-20 hour weekly commitment. They often study early mornings or evenings, adapting their schedule to work patterns.' Emphasize support systems: 'Your student coach can help create a personalized study routine that fits your specific circumstances.' Provide specific examples: 'For instance, one student in a similar role blocks out two weeknight evenings and Sunday mornings for focused study.' Always check understanding: 'How does this approach align with your current commitments?' This method transforms their concern into a practical planning opportunity."

Request an official academic transcript, which needs to show your completed units and grades.' Offer multiple options: 'You can make this request through their online portal, by phone, or via email. I can help you draft the email if you'd like.' Set clear expectations: 'This typically takes 5-7 business days to process. Let's factor this into your enrollment timeline.'
