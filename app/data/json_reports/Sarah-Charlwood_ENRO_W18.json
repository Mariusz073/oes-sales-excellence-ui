I'll send you an email with some information, so if you need to have a little look at anything, it'll all just be there for you' (call_596914863714, seg_48). This passive approach surrendered control of the process to the student and failed to establish concrete next steps.",
                    "recommended_approach": "When students show interest but hesitate to commit, take proactive control of the next steps while maintaining supportive guidance. Instead of leaving follow-up open-ended, use direct language to schedule specific actions: 'I'll send you that information right now, and I'll call you tomorrow at 2pm to discuss any questions - does that time work for you?' This approach maintains momentum while showing respect for their need to review materials. Frame the follow-up call as a valuable opportunity: 'When we speak tomorrow, I can explain how these features specifically benefit your situation and guide you through the next steps.' The key is transforming their 'I'll call you' into a concrete plan that you control, using confident language like: 'Let's secure your spot in the program once we've addressed any questions during our call tomorrow.'"
