Use familiar reference points: 'It works just like HECS - same system, different name for postgraduate studies.' Provide specific details about eligibility and repayment thresholds, using clear examples: 'Once you're earning above $48,000, you'll start making small repayments through your tax. For instance, at a salary of $60,000, your repayments would be approximately $42 per week.' Include multiple payment scenarios: 'Many students combine FEE-HELP with our flexible payment plans - one recent graduate used FEE-HELP for two units while paying directly for others as her salary increased.' Always check understanding and offer to clarify: 'Would you like me to explain more about how the repayments work?' This approach ensures students feel confident about program affordability while maintaining momentum toward enrollment."

Provide specific examples of how this works in practice: 'Our students access lectures and complete assignments around their work schedules - some study early mornings, others late evenings. For instance, one of our current students, a full-time project manager, completes most of her coursework during lunch breaks and evenings.' Address common concerns proactively: 'While everything is online, you'll have rich interaction with instructors and peers through our learning platform. This includes live discussion forums, virtual team projects, and optional study groups.' Share specific success strategies: 'Many students download materials on Sunday for the week ahead, engage in discussions during their commute, and complete assignments in focused evening sessions.' Emphasize support availability: 'Our online support team is available extended hours, from 7am to 11pm, to help with any technical or access needs.' Detail specific flexibility features: 'You can download materials for offline study, access recorded lectures multiple times, and participate in discussions when it suits your schedule.'
