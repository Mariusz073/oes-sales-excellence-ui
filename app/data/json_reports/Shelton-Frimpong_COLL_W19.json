Start with acknowledgment: 'Your interest in project management certification shows clear career focus. Let me explain how our program can support your professional development goals.' Then outline relevant program features: 'While we can't provide specific career advice, I can show you how our program components align with standard project management frameworks.' Share general examples: 'Many of our students find that the knowledge and skills gained in our program support their professional certification goals.' When discussing specific certifications, maintain appropriate pre-enrollment boundaries: 'Once enrolled, our career services team can provide more detailed guidance about integrating your studies with professional certifications.' Use specific examples: 'For instance, our project management units cover key methodologies and frameworks that many students find valuable for their professional development.' The key is demonstrating program value while ensuring expectations are clear and avoiding specific career guidance. Focus on program features that support professional development while clearly indicating what detailed support becomes available post-enrollment."
