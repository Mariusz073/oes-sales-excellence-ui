Start with clear acknowledgment: 'I appreciate you sharing your interest in computer science with me - it's important that your program aligns with your goals.' Then, explore their motivations to ensure proper guidance: 'Could you tell me more about what drew you toward computer science?' This creates opportunity to align their aspirations with available pathways. When presenting the graduate certificate option, frame it as a strategic starting point: 'Many students find that starting with a graduate certificate helps them confirm their interest while building relevant skills. For example, our current computer science students often begin with core programming units that directly transfer into the full degree.' Always provide specific examples: 'One recent student started with the certificate while working full-time, completed the four units with excellent results, and then smoothly transitioned into the full master's program.' Throughout the conversation, emphasize flexibility while maintaining academic rigor: 'The certificate's four units give you focused exposure to key computer science concepts while keeping your long-term options open.' Remember to check understanding and address concerns throughout: 'How does this pathway align with what you were envisioning for your studies?'"
