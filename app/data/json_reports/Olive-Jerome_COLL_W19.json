Be specific about available resources: 'Our student advisors can help with immediate setup needs, and once enrolled, our learning coaches can support your study planning.' Create clear handoff processes: 'I can send you the advisor team's contact details right now, and they typically spend about 15-20 minutes helping with setup.' Maintain proper boundaries while ensuring support: 'While I focus on guiding your enrollment decisions, our specialist teams ensure you have the technical support needed for a smooth start.'"

Start by affirming their readiness: 'It's great that you've received the enrollment materials. Let's ensure you have everything needed for a smooth start.' Create specific checkpoints: 'Would it be helpful if I called you next Tuesday to verify everything's proceeding smoothly?' For immediate action-takers, provide clear next steps: 'Since you have the enrollment letter now, let's quickly review the key setup requirements. Then I can connect you with our advisor team for any technical assistance.' For those preferring to proceed independently, establish specific follow-up points: 'If you're planning to review everything this evening, would you like me to check in tomorrow to address any questions?' Always maintain focus on enrollment-critical tasks while ensuring clear guidance and support pathways."
