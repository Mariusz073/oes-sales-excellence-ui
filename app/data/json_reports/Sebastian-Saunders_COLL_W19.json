This revealed both excitement and apprehension about course commencement, creating an opportunity for comprehensive readiness support.",
          "consultant_response": "The consultant provided verification: 'All right, so it looks like everything's fine on your end. It's just waiting on an admin and that you had a couple potential duplicate IDs, so they were just consolidating those student ID numbers to set up your account.' This effectively addressed immediate concerns while explaining administrative processes.",
          "priority": "high",
          "recommended_approach": "When addressing pre-course concerns, consultants should combine immediate reassurance with comprehensive preparation guidance. Start with validation: 'It's great that you're checking in before Monday - this shows excellent preparation.' Then conduct thorough verification: 'Let's go through your readiness checklist together. I can confirm your enrollment is processed and systems access is being finalized.' Provide specific timing: 'You'll receive your login details by [specific time], giving you plenty of time to access materials before Monday.' Outline support resources: 'Our orientation materials will be available immediately upon login, and our support team is ready to help with any questions. They're available [specific hours] through [specific channels].' Create confidence: 'Many students feel similar pre-start butterflies, but you're clearly well-prepared and will have full support as you begin.' This approach ensures students feel fully equipped for their academic journey."

This presented a perfect moment to explore career goals and ensure program alignment with professional aspirations.",
          "consultant_response": "The interaction concluded with a simple: 'Yeah, just following on that,' missing the opportunity to engage in meaningful discussion about career objectives and how the program supports professional development. This limited response failed to explore the broader context of the student's career journey.",
          "priority": "high",
          "recommended_approach": "When opportunities arise to discuss career goals, consultants should engage while maintaining appropriate boundaries. Start with open exploration: 'Before we finish, I'd love to understand more about your career aspirations and how this program fits into your professional development.' Guide the discussion productively: 'What aspects of your future career most excite you? Understanding this helps ensure you're aware of relevant program features.' Connect goals to program elements: 'Your interest in [specific area] aligns well with our [relevant course component]. Many graduates have found this particularly valuable for [career outcome].' Provide relevant examples: 'Students in similar roles often benefit from our [specific feature] when pursuing [career goal]. Would you like to hear more about how this works?' Remember to maintain focus: 'While detailed career planning comes later with our career services team, understanding your goals helps us ensure you're on the right path.' This approach builds confidence in program choice while staying within appropriate consultation boundaries."
