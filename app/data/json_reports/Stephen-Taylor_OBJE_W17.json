          "consultant_response": "The consultant's response focused primarily on basic online delivery information without fully exploring the scope of the student's resource concerns or providing comprehensive guidance about available support options.

          "recommended_approach": "When addressing resource requirements, start by normalizing the question: 'That's actually a very common and important question - let's make sure you have everything you need to succeed.' Begin with essential requirements: 'You'll need reliable internet access and a computer with updated browsers to access our learning platform. We recommend a laptop with at least 8GB of RAM and a webcam for online discussions.' Then expand to support options: 'Our IT help desk provides 24/7 support if you encounter any technical issues, and our library offers free access to all required software.' Share practical examples of how current students manage their resources: 'Many of our students use their workplace computers for some activities and their personal devices for others. We can discuss how to make that work for your situation.' Address potential concerns proactively: 'If you're worried about specific software costs, we have student licenses available for major programs.' Always conclude with support confirmation: 'Remember, our technical support team is available 24/7 to help you get set up and resolve any issues you might encounter.'"

Follow with exploratory questions: 'Can you tell me more about what's making you feel this way?' This opens space for the student to share their concerns. Then provide specific support and reassurance: 'Many students face similar feelings, and we're here to help you navigate this process.' Share success stories: 'I recently worked with a student who had similar doubts, but after breaking down their concerns and addressing each one, they found their confidence growing week by week.' Offer concrete next steps: 'Let's identify what's causing these feelings and create a plan to address each concern.' Always end with clear support commitments: 'Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and we're here to support you every step of the way.'"
