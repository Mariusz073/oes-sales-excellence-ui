          "student_trigger": "During the call, the student expressed uncertainty about credit transfer options, asking: 'What options there are at Monash just to complete an MBA and see if I can get an RPL or recognition of the units I've done at another university but I mean is that possible?' This question revealed both the student's interest in pursuing further education and their concern about potentially repeating previously completed coursework.",
          "consultant_response": "The consultant demonstrated effective objection handling by providing clear, specific information about credit transfer limits: 'You can get a maximum of six credits so there's 12 units in total you can get only a maximum of 50% of the course credited.' This response was particularly effective because it immediately addressed the feasibility of credit transfer while setting clear expectations about the scope of possible recognition.",
          "priority": "high",
          "recommended_approach": "When addressing credit transfer inquiries, begin by acknowledging the value of prior learning while setting clear expectations about the recognition process: 'I appreciate you bringing up your previous studies. Let's explore how we can maximize their value in your new program.' Then provide specific details about credit limits and requirements: 'For instance, if you've completed core business units in your previous degree, these might be eligible for up to 50% credit transfer.' Share real examples: 'Many students successfully transfer credits for fundamental units like Marketing Management or Financial Accounting. Just last intake, a student transferred six units and completed their remaining requirements within 18 months.' Address timeline implications: 'With six credits transferred, you could potentially complete your remaining units within 18 months part-time, depending on your study load.' Guide through the process: 'The first step is to submit your academic transcripts for assessment. Our team will evaluate each unit against our current curriculum to maximize your eligible credits.' Always verify understanding: 'Would you like me to explain how specific units from your previous study might transfer?' The goal is to ensure clarity while maintaining enthusiasm for the program."

          "student_trigger": "During call 596554884919 (segment 218), the student shared: 'I did study for about a year, two years ago, so I sort of can manage my time to study and work full-time.' This statement revealed both confidence from past experience and an underlying need for reassurance about managing current commitments.",
          "consultant_response": "The consultant effectively validated past experience while introducing institutional support: 'That's great to hear you've managed to study alongside work before. At Monash Online, we've got fantastic resources and support in place to help you balance your study and work commitments effectively.' This response built on the student's existing confidence while ensuring awareness of available resources.",
          "priority": "high",
          "recommended_approach": "When discussing work-study balance, start by acknowledging past successes: 'Your previous experience balancing work and study is valuable - let's build on those strategies with our additional support resources.' Share specific examples: 'Many working professionals use our flexible assessment windows to manage peak work periods. For instance, one student completes readings during lunch breaks and participates in online discussions in the evenings. Another downloads lectures to their tablet for viewing during their commute.' Present concrete support mechanisms: 'Our success coaches can help develop a personalized study schedule that works around your specific work patterns. We also offer 24/7 technical support and recorded lectures for flexible access.' Address common challenges proactively: 'If you travel for work or face busy periods, our asynchronous learning model lets you adjust your study schedule accordingly. For example, many students complete assignments ahead of known busy periods at work.' Always check comfort level: 'How do these flexibility options align with your work patterns?' and offer additional support: 'Would you like to speak with a success coach about creating a customized study plan?' The goal is to build confidence while ensuring awareness of comprehensive support resources."
