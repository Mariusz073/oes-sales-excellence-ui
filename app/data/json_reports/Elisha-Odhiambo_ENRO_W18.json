This question revealed the student's need for clear understanding of career progression paths and their impact on enrollment decision.",
                    "consultant_response": "The consultant provided a basic overview of immediate roles without fully addressing the long-term career progression potential or creating a compelling vision of the student's professional future. This approach missed the opportunity to build confidence in the career pathway and secure stronger enrollment commitment.",
                    "recommended_approach": "When addressing career progression concerns, start by acknowledging the student's career aspirations while creating a clear vision of their professional journey. Begin with confidence: 'Our program provides a strong foundation for your psychology career, and I'll show you exactly how it leads to professional success.' Share specific progression examples: 'Many graduates start in mental health support roles at $75,000, advancing to specialized positions within two years at $95,000. One recent graduate began as a mental health worker and within 18 months became a senior case manager, increasing their salary by 40%.' Use concrete success stories: 'Several of our graduates now lead mental health programs in major hospitals, having completed our program while working.' Always connect career progression back to enrollment: 'Starting in our March intake positions you to begin this career progression by next year. Let's secure your spot now.' For students with specific career goals, provide targeted examples: 'One graduate transitioned from clinical support to running their own practice within three years, generating over $150,000 annually.' The key is creating a compelling vision of their professional future while maintaining strong momentum toward enrollment commitment."

Begin confidently: 'The professional certificate pathway is an excellent option that many successful students have used to achieve their goals. Let me show you exactly how this works.' Then outline specific benefits: 'This pathway not only builds your foundation but also provides guaranteed entry into the advanced program upon completion. In fact, students often perform better in the advanced program after completing the certificate.' Share success stories: 'Last semester, five students completed this pathway and are now excelling in the advanced program, with an average GPA of 6.2.' Maintain momentum by securing immediate commitment: 'Let's get you started on this pathway with our March intake - I can help you complete the enrollment right now.' For hesitant students, provide additional reassurance: 'We'll provide dedicated support throughout your certificate, including one-on-one academic coaching to ensure your success.'

For students showing uncertainty, provide additional reassurance through examples of how you've helped others through similar processes.

Guide the conversation with specific next steps: 'Let's begin your application now while you have this dedicated time. I'll walk you through each step to ensure everything is ready for March.'
