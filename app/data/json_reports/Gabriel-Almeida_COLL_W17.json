Look, we do have three teaching periods per year. They are March, July and November. If in the future you feel in a better place to apply, just reach out to us. I've sent you an email with more information about the course anyway. You have my contact details. If something comes up and you have any questions, just reach out.

Begin with genuine empathy: 'I appreciate you sharing that with me - your wellbeing is the priority right now.' Provide clear information about flexibility: 'We have multiple intake periods throughout the year, so please focus on your recovery knowing there are future opportunities.' Ensure the student feels supported without pressure: 'I'll send you comprehensive information by email for review when you're feeling better. This includes details about our three teaching periods and flexible study options.' Maintain connection while respecting boundaries: 'Please feel free to reach out when you're ready - my contact details will be in the email, and I'm happy to discuss options when you feel better prepared.' This approach demonstrates commitment to student welfare while keeping enrollment pathways open."

Then explore their circumstances further: 'Could you tell me more about what would make this financially manageable for your situation?' This enables a more tailored discussion of support options. While maintaining pre-enrollment boundaries, outline available assistance: 'Many students in similar situations manage their study costs through options like HECS-HELP, which allows you to defer payments until you're earning above the threshold. We also have flexible payment plans and potential pathways for reducing costs through recognition of prior learning.' Use specific examples: 'For instance, many of our students with families use HECS-HELP to avoid immediate out-of-pocket expenses while maintaining their current financial commitments.' Remember to clarify that detailed financial guidance can be provided by student support services post-enrollment."
