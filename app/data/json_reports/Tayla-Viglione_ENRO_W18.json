Instead of accepting vague commitments, respond with clear, action-oriented scheduling: 'I understand you're busy today - let me help by scheduling a specific time tomorrow. Would 10 AM work for you? I'll call you directly to help finalize your enrollment and ensure everything is in place for your start date.' For students expressing hesitation, acknowledge their current state while maintaining momentum: 'I appreciate your honesty about today, and that's exactly why I'd like to schedule our follow-up now. This ensures you have dedicated time tomorrow to complete this important step in your education journey.' Always end with explicit confirmation: 'I'll call you tomorrow at 10 AM to complete your enrollment. This will ensure you secure your spot in the May intake. Does that time work for you?' The goal is to transform tentative interest into firm commitment through specific scheduling and clear ownership of the next steps."
