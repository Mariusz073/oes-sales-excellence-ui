Start by affirming eligibility: 'Yes, as an Australian citizen, you have access to several financial support options, including Commonwealth Supported Places.' Outline practical benefits: 'This means you can defer tuition through HECS-HELP, focusing on studies without upfront payments.' Share specific examples: 'Many students use HECS-HELP effectively, only beginning repayments once their income reaches the threshold.' Integrate support information naturally: 'While we explore your study options, let me explain how our financial support systems make this achievable.' The key is transforming financial considerations from potential barriers into manageable aspects of their educational journey through clear, supportive guidance and practical examples."
