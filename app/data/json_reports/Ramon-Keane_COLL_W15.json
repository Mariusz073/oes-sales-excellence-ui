In the primary example, the student inquired: 'And also just like, so even if there are no like scholarship positions or something for this course' (call_595732395885, seg_114), indicating a need for detailed information about financial aid opportunities beyond basic FEE-HELP.",
          "consultant_response": "Consultants typically acknowledged scholarship existence but provided limited detailed information about specific opportunities or application processes, missing chances to fully address financial concerns.",

          "recommended_approach": "When exploring financial aid options, begin with a comprehensive overview: 'Let's explore all available financial support options to help make your education more affordable.' Structure the discussion systematically: 'We have several categories of support - government assistance like FEE-HELP, institutional scholarships, and flexible payment arrangements.' Provide specific details: 'Our merit-based scholarships can reduce fees by up to 25%, and we have special grants for career transition students.' Include practical guidance: 'Let me walk you through the application requirements and deadlines for each option.' Always create clear next steps: 'I'll send you a detailed financial aid guide with links to all application forms and support resources.' The key is transforming financial aid discussions from general information to specific, actionable plans that help students feel confident about their ability to manage educational costs."
