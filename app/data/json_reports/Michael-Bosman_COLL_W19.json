Provide comprehensive information while maintaining appropriate boundaries: 'As an Australian citizen, you have access to FEE-HELP, meaning no upfront payments are required. Many students combine this with flexible payment arrangements to manage their investment effectively.' Use specific examples: 'Some students choose to pay partially upfront to reduce their loan, while others utilize FEE-HELP entirely. The key is finding an approach that works for your circumstances.' Always ensure students understand both immediate costs and long-term financial planning options: 'While I can't provide financial advice, I can connect you with our finance team to explore these options in more detail.'"
