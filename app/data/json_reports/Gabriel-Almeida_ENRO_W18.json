This proactive inquiry about documentation deadlines presented an opportunity to establish clear timelines and maintain strong enrollment momentum.",
                    "consultant_response": "The consultant effectively moved the process forward by stating: 'Yeah, the sooner you can get it, the better, because we can check your eligibility.

Begin with explicit confirmation: 'Excellent, let's lock in Monday as your submission deadline. I'll personally review your documents as soon as they arrive.' Then outline the specific sequence: 'Here's exactly what will happen: Once you submit on Monday, I'll check everything within 2 hours and confirm your eligibility. Then we'll immediately book your CASPer test for later that week.' Create accountability through specific follow-up: 'I will call you Tuesday at 10am to confirm receipt and guide you through the next steps. Can you confirm that time works for you?' Address any timeline concerns immediately with solutions: 'If you're worried about meeting the Monday deadline, we can review your documents together now to ensure everything is ready.' Always maintain momentum by linking each step to enrollment progress, demonstrating strong leadership throughout the documentation process."

Let me show you how our program is specifically designed for students in your situation.' Share success stories: 'Many of our current students had similar concerns before starting. For instance, Maria was hesitant about timing but found our flexible study options made it the perfect time to begin.' Address timing objections with clear solutions: 'Our program lets you adjust your study load each term based on your commitments. You can start with two units, then increase or decrease based on your comfort level.' Move to immediate commitment: 'Let's review your schedule now and identify the best study patterns for you. Then we can secure your place in the upcoming intake while this flexibility is still available.' Always maintain focus on converting timing concerns into manageable solutions while guiding students toward enrollment commitment."

I'll have all the enrollment forms ready, and we can complete them together during the call.' Create mutual commitment: 'So I'll speak with you at 2pm, and we'll aim to have your enrollment completed by 2:30. Does that timeline work for you?' Address any scheduling concerns immediately with alternatives: 'If 2pm doesn't work, I can also call at 3pm or 4pm - which would you prefer?' Always maintain strong momentum through specific, mutually agreed-upon commitments while demonstrating clear leadership of the enrollment process."
