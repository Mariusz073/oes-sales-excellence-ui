                    "recommended_approach": "When addressing HECS and financial queries, lead with clear, authoritative information that builds confidence in the financial aspects of enrollment. Begin with direct acknowledgment: 'Understanding HECS repayment is crucial for your planning, let me walk you through exactly how it works.' Then provide specific, accurate information: 'HECS repayments only begin when your income reaches the threshold, currently at $48,000. The repayments are automatically calculated as a percentage of your income, starting at 1% and increasing gradually.' Use real examples to illustrate: 'For instance, if you're earning $75,000 as a teacher, your repayment would be approximately $3,750 per year, automatically managed through your tax.' Always direct students to official resources: 'You can find detailed information on the StudyAssist website, which I'll include in my follow-up email, along with our HECS-HELP guide.' The key is to transform financial concerns from potential barriers into manageable aspects of their educational journey through clear, authoritative guidance. End with confidence-building assurance: 'Let's schedule a follow-up call tomorrow at 2pm to review any other financial questions and proceed with your enrollment.'"

One recent graduate adjusted her study load before her due date and resumed full-time study three months later.' When discussing breaks, frame them as strategic opportunities: 'These scheduled breaks allow you to focus fully on important life events while maintaining your academic progress.'
