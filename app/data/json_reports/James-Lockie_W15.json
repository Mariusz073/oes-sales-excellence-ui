This statement revealed both an openness to exploring educational pathways and a desire for thoughtful consideration before making commitments. It presented a crucial opportunity to engage in collaborative planning that could help guide their exploration while maintaining momentum toward enrollment.",
          "consultant_response": "The consultant's response of 'No worries, Rehema. Look forward' (call_595658615452, seg_77) failed to capitalize on the student's openness to exploration. While maintaining a supportive tone, this brief response missed the opportunity to engage in meaningful discussion about potential pathways or to offer structured guidance for their period of reflection.",
          "priority": "high",
          "recommended_approach": "When students express a desire to explore their options, transform this potential delay into a structured exploration opportunity. Begin by validating their thoughtful approach while maintaining momentum: 'Taking time to evaluate your options is wise - let's explore what you're considering so I can provide relevant information for your research.' Guide the conversation with purposeful questions about their interests, career goals, and decision-making criteria. Share how different program elements align with various career paths, using specific examples: 'Many students in similar situations have found that starting with our graduate certificate provides a perfect way to validate their interest while building credits toward the full master's degree.' Provide structured guidance for their exploration period, such as suggesting specific program aspects to research, industry areas to investigate, or professionals to connect with. The key is maintaining engagement while respecting their need for consideration time, offering to schedule a follow-up discussion to review their findings and answer emerging questions."
