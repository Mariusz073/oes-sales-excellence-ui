In call 597062272257 (segment 74), the student asked 'So once I fill that transfer form?' needing guidance on post-form procedures. These moments required immediate process control and action steps to maintain enrollment momentum.",

These responses failed to maintain strong process control or provide clear direction with immediate action items.",
                    "recommended_approach": "To maintain effective process control, consultants must provide explicit guidance while maintaining momentum through immediate action. Begin every process discussion with clear ownership and immediate steps: 'Let me walk you through exactly what happens next - we can complete your enrollment form together right now.' Then provide specific timelines with immediate action: 'First, we'll complete your enrollment form today - it takes about 15 minutes. Within 48 hours, you'll receive confirmation and access to your student portal. Let's start with the form now.' Always include immediate enrollment opportunities: 'I can guide you through this right now - would you prefer to start with the enrollment form or schedule your orientation session first? Both will take just a few minutes to complete.' When discussing future steps, maintain control with specific commitments: 'I'll call you tomorrow at 2 PM to finalize these details. Would you prefer 2 PM or 3 PM for our call?'"

Then, use this momentum to guide toward specific next steps: 'Since you're feeling confident with the support available, let's secure your enrollment right now - I can help you complete the form in just 15 minutes.' Pay particular attention to transitional moments where students need reassurance about ongoing support. For instance, if discussing documentation requirements, say 'Your advisor will guide you through each step of the document submission process - they've helped countless students through this exact journey. Let's schedule your first advisor meeting now as we complete your enrollment.' Always conclude support discussions with immediate action: 'Let's get your enrollment finalized now so you can begin accessing these support services right away.'"
