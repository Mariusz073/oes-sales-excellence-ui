The key is making flexibility tangible rather than theoretical. For instance, explain how asynchronous learning means no mandatory live sessions, and offline access means study can happen even in areas with poor connectivity. For those with rotating rosters, emphasize how weekly study patterns can adapt to changing schedules. Pay particular attention to students working night shifts or long rotations, showing how our platform's flexibility specifically addresses these challenges. The goal is to transform perceived scheduling barriers into manageable planning opportunities, always grounding explanations in healthcare-specific scenarios that resonate with their experience."

          "student_trigger": "In call 621608967453 (segment 97), the student directly sought career clarity: 'So the Bachelor of Psychological Sciences, what does that, like? What happens at the end of it?' This question revealed a critical need to understand the practical value and career outcomes of their potential educational investment, presenting a key opportunity to strengthen their enrollment commitment through clear career pathway articulation.",
          "consultant_response": "The consultant provided limited career information: 'So with this specific degree, it is kind of created for students who are wanting to become psychologists within Australia' (call_621608967453, seg_103). While accurate, this response focused narrowly on one career path without exploring broader opportunities or immediate employment possibilities, potentially limiting the student's understanding of the degree's versatility.",
          "priority": "high",
          "recommended_approach": "When students inquire about career outcomes, start by exploring their specific interests within the field: 'What aspects of psychology particularly interest you? Are you drawn more to clinical work, research, or organizational psychology?' Then, provide comprehensive career pathway information: 'This degree opens multiple career paths - from becoming a registered psychologist to roles in human resources, social services, research, or corporate training.' Share specific examples and timelines: 'For instance, some graduates work immediately in youth services or human resources, while others pursue further study to become clinical psychologists.' Always connect program features to career preparation: 'Our curriculum includes practical placements and research projects that build skills valued across multiple sectors.' Include success stories: 'One recent graduate now works as a behavior specialist in schools, while another leads corporate training programs.' The goal is to paint a comprehensive picture of career possibilities while remaining grounded in the student's interests and goals."

Start by validating their concern: 'It's great that you're thinking carefully about managing your study commitments. Let's explore this together.' Then probe deeper: 'What are your main commitments currently?' Use this information to suggest specific strategies: 'Many students with similar schedules find success by breaking their study into smaller blocks throughout the week.' Share examples of successful students' approaches: 'One of our current students manages their study by dedicating early mornings before work, while others prefer evening sessions.' Emphasize flexibility and support options: 'Our learning platform allows you to access materials anytime, and our support team can help you develop a personalized study schedule.' The key is transforming their concern into a concrete plan while maintaining realistic expectations about the commitment required."
