Start with specific closing dates: 'The March intake closes this Friday at 5pm, and we currently have only 3 spots remaining.' Then add context about future implications: 'The next intake isn't until July, and based on current applications, we expect all spots to fill before then.' Follow this with immediate action steps: 'Let's secure your spot now while I can help you directly.' Share specific examples of how early enrollment benefits students: 'Students who enrolled early last intake were able to complete their first assignment before classes started, giving them a strong advantage.' The key is balancing urgency with support - avoid pressure tactics in favor of helpful guidance. For instance, say 'I want to ensure you don't miss out on your preferred start date' rather than just emphasizing scarcity. Always conclude with a clear call to action: 'Shall we complete your enrollment form now? It only takes about 15 minutes, and I'll guide you through each step.'"

Then connect their existing skills to academic success: 'Your 15 years of work experience gives you valuable advantages - you've developed time management and problem-solving skills that directly apply to university study.' Share specific success stories: 'Just last term, we had a student return after 18 years who completed her first unit with distinctions, using the exact support services I'll connect you with.' Follow with concrete support mechanisms: 'Before classes start, you'll have access to our study skills refresh program, one-on-one academic support sessions, and a dedicated advisor to help you transition back to study.' Always end with a clear support plan: 'Let's schedule your first academic support session now, even before classes begin, so you'll start with confidence. Then we can complete your enrollment while I explain each step of the support journey.'"
