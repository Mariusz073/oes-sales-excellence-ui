(call_597148339897, seg_139). This question revealed underlying anxiety about financial obligations and demonstrated the student's need for clarity regarding payment structures. The timing and nature of this question indicated it was a potential barrier to enrollment that needed immediate addressing to maintain momentum in the enrollment process.",
                    "response": "The consultant demonstrated strong enrollment closing behavior by responding clearly and confidently with 'You just pay per unit or you can put it all onto FeeHelp which is a student loan' (call_597148339897, seg_141). This response effectively addressed the student's concerns by presenting clear, manageable options. The direct communication style and immediate presentation of solutions helped transform a potential barrier into a path forward. By providing specific payment options, the consultant maintained control of the conversation while empowering the student with clear choices, ultimately contributing to increased confidence in proceeding with enrollment.",
                    "recommendation": "When addressing financial concerns, consultants should recognize these moments as critical opportunities to demonstrate the program's accessibility while maintaining enrollment momentum. Begin by acknowledging the importance of financial planning, then immediately present clear, specific payment options. For example, 'I understand managing the financial commitment is important. Let me walk you through your options - you can either pay per unit as you study, which many students find manageable, or utilize FeeHelp to defer the entire amount.' Always frame the discussion in terms of solutions rather than obstacles, using confident language that assumes progression toward enrollment. Make the FeeHelp option tangible by explaining specifics: 'With FeeHelp, you won't start repayments until your income reaches the threshold, currently at $47,014.' Follow up by checking the student's preference: 'Which of these payment options would work better for your situation?' This approach maintains momentum while ensuring the student feels supported in their financial decision-making. Once a preferred payment option is identified, immediately move to secure enrollment: 'Now that we've clarified the payment structure, shall we proceed with your enrollment for the upcoming intake?'"
