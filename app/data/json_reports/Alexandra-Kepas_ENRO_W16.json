Start with clarification: 'Let me make this simple - we just need your resume with your work history, and I'll help you get that ready.' Then take immediate action: 'I'm sending our resume template to your email now - let me know when you receive it.' Guide through specific sections: 'Let's look at the template together. Start with your current role details, and I'll show you exactly how to format the dates and responsibilities.' Set clear timelines: 'Most students complete this in about 30 minutes. I'll call you tomorrow at 2pm to review what you've done and help finalize any sections.' Always maintain support continuity: 'Feel free to start filling it out, and I'll be here to answer any questions. Then during our call tomorrow, we can ensure everything is formatted perfectly for your application.' This approach transforms what might seem like a complex requirement into a straightforward task with immediate, ongoing support. End with specific commitment: 'Let's aim to submit your completed resume by Friday - I'll call you tomorrow at 2pm to check your progress and answer any questions.'"

By referring to potentially unreliable tools and failing to provide concrete information, the consultant missed an opportunity to build confidence in the financial aspects of enrollment.",
                    "recommended_approach": "When addressing HECS and financial queries, lead with clear, authoritative information that builds confidence in the financial aspects of enrollment. Begin with direct acknowledgment: 'Understanding HECS repayment is crucial for your planning, let me walk you through exactly how it works.' Then provide specific, accurate information: 'HECS repayments only begin when your income reaches the threshold, currently at $48,000. The repayments are automatically calculated as a percentage of your income, starting at 1% and increasing gradually.' Use real examples to illustrate: 'For instance, if you're earning $75,000 as a teacher, your repayment would be approximately $3,750 per year, automatically managed through your tax.' Always direct students to official resources: 'You can find detailed information on the StudyAssist website, which I'll include in my follow-up email, along with our HECS-HELP guide.' The key is to transform financial concerns from potential barriers into manageable aspects of their educational journey through clear, authoritative guidance. End with confidence-building assurance: 'Let's schedule a follow-up call tomorrow at 2pm to review any other financial questions and proceed with your enrollment.'"
