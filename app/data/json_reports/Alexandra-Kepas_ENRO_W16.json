Let's break this down into manageable steps. First, shall we explore the payment options available? I can walk you through those right now. Then, we can secure your place while I guide you through the document submission process. Would you have your documents ready for review by this Wednesday? I can schedule a call at 2pm to help you through that process.' Adaptation needed: Should have recognized the financial concern as a key trigger for deeper discussion Needed to provide specific support for both document submission and financial planning Could have scheduled a concrete follow-up appointment to maintain momentum Should have demonstrated proactive support rather than leaving the initiative with the student"
