Then highlight the census date flexibility: 'You'll have until April 4th to experience the program and make any adjustments without financial penalty.' For students comparing different qualification levels, emphasize how the trial period helps build confidence: 'Many students find that starting with a lighter load helps them develop effective study habits before increasing their commitment.' Share specific success stories: 'For example, one of our current students started with two units while working full-time, found their rhythm in the first term, and is now confidently managing a full study load.' Always connect the immediate step to their longer-term goals: 'This approach lets you experience the program quality while keeping your options open.' The key is transforming the perception from a daunting three-year commitment into an achievable step-by-step journey with clear support at each stage."
