Your wellbeing is important to us, and we have comprehensive support systems in place.' Provide immediate, specific information about available resources: 'Let me walk you through our mental health support services, including our counseling team, academic support advisors, and flexible study arrangements.' Share specific examples of support mechanisms: 'Our counseling services offer both online and in-person sessions, with extended hours to accommodate different schedules. Many students find our flexible assessment arrangements helpful during challenging periods.' Outline clear access pathways and verify the student feels supported: 'Would you like me to explain any of these services in more detail, or would you prefer to discuss specific accommodations you might need?'"

Use specific examples of successful career changers: 'Many of our graduates have successfully transitioned from various fields into psychology careers. For instance, we had a former business professional who now works in organizational psychology.' Detail the program elements that specifically support career development, such as industry engagement opportunities, networking events, and career guidance services. Maintain focus on connecting program components to career outcomes while ensuring the student understands both the challenges and supports available during their transition."
