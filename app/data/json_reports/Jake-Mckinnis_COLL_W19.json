So if you're working three night shifts, you might download everything on Monday, use those quiet periods around 2-3am for focused reading, then complete your discussion posts during your recovery days.' This specific, healthcare-focused approach resonates more deeply than general statements about flexibility.

          "student_trigger": "During call 597437723923 (segment 106), the student directly addressed cost concerns: 'Just the cost of it, because I know that you guys like, so it says $25,000 per year, which is fine, but it's a fair bit higher than the others.' This statement revealed both awareness of comparative costs and potential hesitation about the financial commitment, presenting a crucial opportunity for collaborative financial planning.",
          "consultant_response": "The consultant's response was primarily informational rather than collaborative: 'Yeah, so the total costing of our course, short answer, is about $50,000 for our degree. There are subsidies that students can apply for, however, the onus is always on the student to do that' (segment 110). While providing accurate information, this approach missed the opportunity to engage in meaningful financial planning discussion or explore specific support options.",
          "priority": "high",
          "recommended_approach": "When addressing cost concerns, start by acknowledging the significance of financial investment in education before transitioning into a collaborative exploration of available support options. Begin with validation: 'I appreciate you bringing up the cost - it's an important factor to consider carefully.' Then guide the conversation toward specific financial pathways, such as FEE-HELP, scholarships, or flexible payment arrangements. Share success stories of how current students manage their financial commitments, always relating these examples to the student's specific situation. Pay particular attention to their employment status or industry connections that might affect access to additional financial support or employer assistance programs. Transform cost discussions from potential barriers into collaborative planning opportunities by demonstrating how various support mechanisms can make the investment manageable."

This direct question revealed both clear career goals and a need for detailed pathway planning, presenting a crucial opportunity to demonstrate how the institution could support their professional aspirations.",
          "consultant_response": "The consultant provided basic program information: 'We offer two master's programs...Master's of Teaching Primary and Master's of Teaching Secondary' (call_621609276501, seg_69).

          "recommended_approach": "When students express interest in specific teaching pathways, begin by exploring their particular subject interests and career aspirations before outlining program options. Start with deeper exploration: 'What subjects are you most passionate about teaching?' This information helps tailor the guidance while showing genuine interest in their goals. Create clear connections between their interests and program specializations, demonstrating how specific courses align with their teaching aspirations. Pay special attention to any unique circumstances or previous experience that might influence their pathway choices. Focus on building a comprehensive understanding of their career vision to ensure program recommendations fully support their professional goals while maintaining appropriate pre-enrollment boundaries."

          "recommended_approach": "When students express concerns about returning to study, consultants should create a supportive planning environment that addresses specific anxieties while highlighting available resources. Begin with validation: 'Many successful students share similar concerns about returning to study, and we have comprehensive support to help you transition back.' Then outline specific support systems: 'Our program includes dedicated resources for returning students, including study skills workshops, academic writing support, and one-on-one coaching.' Share success strategies: 'Many returning students find success by starting with our study skills refresher module, which helps rebuild academic confidence.' Create a clear pathway: 'Let's look at the specific resources that would be most helpful for your situation.' Throughout the discussion, maintain focus on building confidence through practical support: 'Our learning coaches specialize in helping students return to study successfully, and they'll be available to support you throughout your journey.'"
