          "recommended_approach": "When addressing documentation challenges, begin by validating concerns while immediately positioning yourself as an active partner in finding solutions. Start with empathy: 'I understand these changes can make obtaining documentation challenging. Let's work together to find the best approach.' Outline specific action steps: 'First, let's identify all possible pathways for obtaining your documentation. While contacting your previous university is one option, we can also explore alternatives like academic transcripts or course descriptions.' Create a clear action plan: 'Let's develop a step-by-step approach, starting with the most readily available documents while pursuing additional options.' Share success strategies: 'Many students in similar situations have successfully gathered documentation by requesting detailed academic transcripts and course outlines.' Always maintain momentum by setting clear next steps: 'Let's schedule a follow-up call once you've gathered initial documents to review progress and plan next steps.' The key is transforming documentation requirements from barriers into manageable tasks through structured planning and clear guidance."

          "recommended_approach": "When engaging with students returning to study after a break, begin by validating their feelings while building confidence about moving forward. Start with acknowledgment: 'Many successful students wish they'd started earlier, but your previous experiences can actually enhance your studies now.' Ask questions that prompt forward thinking: 'What aspects of the program most excite you?' or 'How do you see your previous experience contributing to your studies?' Share success stories of similar students: 'One of our recent graduates returned to study after ten years and found their work experience gave them valuable insights.' Outline specific support mechanisms: 'Our learning advisors specialize in helping returning students transition back to academic writing and study skills.' Always connect past experiences to future success: 'Your work and life experience can actually enhance your studies, giving you practical context for theoretical concepts.' The key is transforming past hesitation into future motivation through practical support strategies and confidence-building approaches while maintaining clear focus on immediate enrollment steps."
