This query revealed the need for clear financial guidance while maintaining appropriate boundaries between sales and financial advisory roles.",
          "consultant_response": "The consultant provided basic information: 'Yeah, so as an Australian citizen you are eligible for HECS. Basically what HECS is, is a zero interest loan from the Australian government' (segment 64). While offering fundamental details about HECS, this response missed the opportunity to engage in a more collaborative exploration of financial planning options while maintaining appropriate boundaries.",

          "recommended_approach": "When addressing financial queries, maintain clear boundaries while providing helpful guidance. Begin with validating their concerns: 'Understanding the financial aspects is an important part of your educational planning' before explaining available options. While maintaining appropriate boundaries, outline various support mechanisms: 'As an Australian citizen, you have access to HECS-HELP, which lets you defer payment until you're earning above the threshold. While I can't provide financial advice, I can connect you with our financial advisory team who can discuss your individual circumstances in detail.' Guide students through general information about payment options, scholarships, and flexible payment arrangements, always ensuring they understand how to access detailed guidance when needed. The goal is to demonstrate comprehensive financial support options while maintaining appropriate advisory boundaries."

This statement indicated both readiness to return to study and potential uncertainty about the transition, presenting a crucial opportunity for supportive guidance in their re-entry to education.",
          "consultant_response": "The consultant offered a basic acknowledgment: 'Yeah, absolutely. How can I help you with that one?' While friendly, this response missed the opportunity to explore the student's readiness more deeply or provide specific support strategies for returning to study. The interaction could have been enhanced with more targeted guidance and confidence-building discussion.",
          "priority": "high",
          "recommended_approach": "When students indicate readiness to return to study, begin by validating their decision while providing structured support for the transition. Start with acknowledgment: 'It's great that you're feeling ready to take this step - many successful students return to study when they feel the timing is right.' Then explore their specific circumstances: 'What aspects of returning to study are you most excited about, and what areas would you like support with?' Share concrete examples of support mechanisms: 'Our study skill refresher resources and flexible study options help many returning students transition back smoothly.' When discussing academic preparation, provide specific strategies: 'Many returning students start with our Learning and Communication Online unit, which helps rebuild academic confidence while developing essential study skills.' Throughout the discussion, emphasize available support services: 'You'll have access to academic skills workshops, online tutoring, and dedicated advisors who specialize in supporting returning students.' The goal is to transform their readiness into confidence while providing clear pathways for successful re-entry to education."
