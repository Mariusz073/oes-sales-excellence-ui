Use specific examples to illustrate the practicality: 'For instance, if you're earning $45,000, you won't make any repayments until your income reaches the threshold, currently at $48,000.' Always explain both immediate and long-term implications: 'The government pays your fees directly to the university, and you only begin repaying once you're earning above the threshold, with payments adjusted to your income level.' When discussing costs, frame them in the context of career investment: 'While considering the costs, let's also look at how this qualification typically impacts earning potential in your field. Many of our graduates report salary increases within the first year after completion.' Remember to check understanding frequently and provide written follow-up: 'I'll email you a detailed breakdown of these options, including current thresholds and repayment rates.

Start with validating statements like 'I understand managing work and study can feel overwhelming at first' before transitioning to practical planning. The key is demonstrating how our program's flexibility directly addresses their unique situation. For example, ask detailed questions about their work schedule: 'Could you tell me about your typical weekly roster?' then connect specific program features to their schedule: 'With your three-day rotation, you might find our asynchronous learning approach particularly helpful.' Pay special attention to shift workers, offering concrete examples of how current students successfully manage similar patterns. Always conclude by confirming the student sees how the program can accommodate their schedule: 'How do you feel about managing your studies with these flexible options?'"
