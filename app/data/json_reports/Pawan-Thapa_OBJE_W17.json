Then explore their specific situation: 'Could you tell me more about your typical work schedule?' This allows for tailored examples of how our program features align with their needs. Share specific success strategies: 'Many of our working students download lecture materials before their workday and review them during lunch breaks or after hours. Others prefer to dedicate weekend mornings to coursework.' When discussing lecture times, emphasize both scheduled options and recording availability: 'While lectures are held after 6pm, they're all recorded for next-day viewing, giving you complete flexibility in when you engage with the material.' Include examples of how current students manage various schedules: 'One of our current students, also working full-time, breaks their study into 30-minute segments during quiet periods at work, while another dedicates two evenings per week to focused study.' Always conclude by confirming their comfort with the flexibility options: 'How do these study patterns align with your work schedule?'"

Then outline specific pathways: 'Let me show you the various routes available to meet our entry requirements.' Share relevant success stories: 'Recently, a student in a similar situation completed their missing requirement through Open University while preparing for enrollment with us. They're now excelling in our program.' Present options clearly: 'You could either complete the prerequisite through Swinburne directly, which typically takes [timeframe], or through Open University, which offers more flexible scheduling.'
