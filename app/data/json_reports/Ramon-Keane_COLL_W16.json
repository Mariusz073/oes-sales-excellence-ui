Walk through a typical study block timeline, showing how the structure supports different learning approaches: 'During each six-week block, you'll have clear weekly milestones, flexible study options, and dedicated support. The two-week breaks between units provide valuable time for reflection and preparation.' Connect structural elements to specific student success strategies: 'The focused single-unit approach means you can fully immerse yourself in each topic, which many students find leads to deeper understanding and better retention.' The key is helping students visualize their success within this structure while maintaining momentum toward enrollment."
