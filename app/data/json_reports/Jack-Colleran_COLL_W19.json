This moment represented an opportunity to demonstrate institutional reliability and commitment to student support, as the student was actively seeking resolution of previous discussions.",
          "consultant_response": "The consultant's response of 'No worries' (call_123456789012, seg_15) failed to address the underlying need for clear follow-up planning and resolution. This minimal response missed the opportunity to demonstrate proactive support and provide clear next steps, potentially leaving the student uncertain about progress toward resolution.",
          "priority": "high",
          "recommended_approach": "When students initiate follow-up contact, immediately demonstrate both acknowledgment of previous interactions and clear commitment to resolution through specific actions. Begin with appreciation and context: 'Thank you for following up. I can see from your previous conversation that you were discussing [specific topic]. Let's ensure we address everything from that discussion and move forward with clear next steps.' Then outline a specific action plan: 'First, let's confirm your documentation requirements - you'll need your transcripts and identification. Then we'll review your eligibility and map out the enrollment timeline.' Create immediate action items: 'Let's start by reviewing your qualifications while you gather these documents. I'll note in your file that we're aiming to complete the eligibility check by [specific date] and begin the enrollment process by [specific date].' The key is maintaining momentum through clear steps, specific timelines, and tangible progress markers."

          "priority": "high",
          "recommended_approach": "When students disclose prior qualifications, immediately demonstrate the value of their existing achievements while providing clear pathways for recognition. Start with specific acknowledgment: 'Your diploma and Certificate III represent significant progress toward your goal. Let me explain how these qualifications can benefit your journey with us.' Then outline the recognition process with clear steps: 'We have a structured process for assessing prior learning. You'll need to provide your transcripts and course outlines, which our academic team will review for maximum credit recognition.' Share specific examples: 'For instance, students with similar qualifications often receive exemptions for foundational units, allowing them to focus on advanced topics.' Always maintain appropriate boundaries by noting: 'While I can explain the general process and benefits, our academic team will make the final assessment once you're enrolled, ensuring you receive all eligible credits.' The key is demonstrating how prior learning creates tangible advantages while providing clear guidance through the recognition process."
