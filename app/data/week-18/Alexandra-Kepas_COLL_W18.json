This revealed both previous academic attempts and significant professional growth, presenting an opportunity to explore how their management experience could enhance their studies.",

          "priority": "high",
          "recommended_approach": "When students reveal past study attempts and significant work experience, engage them in exploring how these experiences can enhance their current educational journey. Begin with acknowledging their resilience: 'Your journey from previous study attempts to becoming a restaurant manager during COVID shows impressive adaptability. That kind of resilience is valuable in education.' Then explore specific skills: 'Restaurant management involves complex people and operational skills - these experiences directly relate to many aspects of our business program.' Use their responses to demonstrate program relevance: 'Your experience managing teams and operations aligns particularly well with our organizational behavior and leadership units. Many successful students bring similar real-world experience to their studies.' Address previous study challenges by highlighting program flexibility: 'Understanding your past university experience helps us ensure you have the right support this time. Our flexible study options mean you can balance work and study effectively, and our student success team is here to help you navigate any challenges.' The key is transforming past challenges into current advantages while building confidence in their ability to succeed."

Begin with clear guidance: 'I appreciate you wanting to ensure you provide the right documentation. Let me make this straightforward by sending you our template.' Then outline the process step-by-step: 'Here's exactly what we need: first, I'll email you our resume template, which is designed specifically for highlighting your relevant experience. Many students find it helpful because it clearly shows where to list your roles and qualifications.' Follow with immediate action: 'I'm sending that template now, and I'll CC our advisor Bridget who will help review it once completed. She's helped many students through this exact process.' Always close with clear expectations: 'Once you receive the template, take your time to fill it out, and aim to return it within the next few days if possible. We'll confirm receipt within 24 hours and let you know if we need anything else.' This approach combines practical support with clear communication, reducing anxiety about documentation requirements while maintaining momentum."
