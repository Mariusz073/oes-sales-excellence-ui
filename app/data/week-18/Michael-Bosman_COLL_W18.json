Share general examples while maintaining appropriate scope: 'Many students work with our learning coaches to develop study techniques that align with their learning style.' Throughout the conversation, emphasize the comprehensive nature of support while keeping discussions within pre-enrollment bounds: 'While I can't detail specific accommodations now, I can assure you we have robust support systems in place.' The goal is demonstrating institutional commitment to student success while maintaining appropriate advisory boundaries."
