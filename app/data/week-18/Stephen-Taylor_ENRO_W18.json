Then explore their specific situation: 'Let's look at your typical week and identify potential study windows. Many of our working parents find success studying early mornings or evenings.' Provide concrete examples: 'For instance, one of our current students, also a parent of four, completes readings during her lunch break and participates in online discussions after the kids' bedtime.' Always maintain momentum toward enrollment: 'Given your schedule, would you like to secure your place in our next intake? We can start with the minimum study load of 10 hours per week and adjust as you become more comfortable.' The key is transforming perceived barriers into manageable planning opportunities while guiding toward commitment with specific next steps and enrollment timeline."
