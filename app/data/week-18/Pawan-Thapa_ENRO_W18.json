Start by confirming program flexibility: 'Our program is specifically designed for working professionals like yourself. Let me show you exactly how our current students balance their studies with full-time work.' Then transition directly to securing commitment: 'Given your work schedule, the May intake would be perfect timing. Shall we secure your spot now while ensuring your preferred study schedule?' Address any hesitations by sharing specific success examples: 'Many of our students find that downloading materials for offline study during quiet work periods helps them maintain steady progress.' Throughout the conversation, maintain focus on how program flexibility enables successful study-work integration while guiding toward immediate enrollment action."
